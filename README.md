# Hyperion
Hyperion MOD for the Emperor of the Fading Suns V1.5 Game

# Description
This is a public repository for my work on the Hyperion MOD.

# Details
This repository will contain the files for the Hyperion MOD for EFS V1.5. The first version will be a "lite" version in which there are no new units between the standard EFS V1.5 UNIT.DAT and the Hyperion Lite MOD. This MOD can be thought of as a "Hyperionized" version of the standard EFS V1.5 DAT files.

Even though the Lite version will have no new units, it will have all the changes in the game mechanics that I intend to implement in the various MODifiable files, including EFS.INI, various DAT files, and many more.

Hyperion specializes in developing a very satisfying game playing experience that will require the player to manage their empire with much better skill than the standard game in order to be successful.

# Background
I created Hyperion for EFS back in the day during the late 1990's as I was inspired by the Nova MOD. I spent the next several years working on Hyperion with the last version, 1.4, released around the 2003 or so time frame and it was one of the most popular MODs at the time.

Realizing that I could never perfect the MOD with the deficiencies in the previous V1.4 EFS release, I acquired the game code from Andrew Greenberg and started working on fixing the game. Unfortunately, I did not have the requisite C++ programming experience / skill to fix many of the issues with the original code and so went through 3 different development periods between 2005 to 2008, 2015, and 2017, burning out each time due to my inability to fix the game code.

Nonetheless, all this development was saved in an Assembla repository where the changes that I made were put into "cold strorage" where they could still be accessed if needed.

This past December 2021, I was once again contacted by Andrew to work on EFS V1.5. I decided to try once again, but this time we had an experienced C++ programmer on the team, Aleksandr Dorogov, and he was able to solve pretty much all the issues that I couldn't and I was allowed to focus on fixing / changing the issues that I could. I brought my changes out of cold storage that I worked on in the past (some of them were 15+ years old!) and one by one, started putting these changes into the eventual EFS V1.5. To this end, using Hyperion as my guide, the development team (which also includes Boris Okolodkov, who did a lot of the FLC art for Hyperion, Andrew, and Nikolai Skauge, who is a fellow MODder and has been running the EFS Discord channel for many years keeping EFS's heartbeat going) was able to create EFS V1.5 that has many of the previous issues / restrictions either fixed or lifted.

Now that we have released EFS V1.5, I can put my MODding hat back on and get into the art of MODding again!

# Schedule
I plan on releasing Hyperion V1.5 Lite in the October time frame and it is my hope to have the full version of Hyperion released before the end of the year (2022). We'll see how it goes, but thanks for taking the time to read this and to understand how my passion in the game has been rekindled and it is my hope to provide you with a fun, challenging, and enjoyable EFS gaming experience.

Note that during this period of time, I am also working with the development team on releasing EFS V1.51 at the end of 2022 as well. As I work on Hyperion and as issues come up from the various people playing the game, we can fix issues that are discovered in the MODding arena, which will undergo signficant more playtesting and scrutiny in the next few months.
