# Hyperion
Hyperion MOD for the Emperor of the Fading Suns V1.5 Game

# Description
This is a public repository for my work on the Hyperion MOD.

# Details
This repository will contain the files for the Hyperion MOD for EFS V1.5. I've released a "lite" version in which there are no new units between the standard EFS V1.5 UNIT.DAT and the Hyperion Lite MOD. This MOD can be thought of as a "Hyperionized" version of the standard EFS V1.5 DAT files and is available to play now.

Even though the Lite version will has no new units, it has 90% of the changes in the game mechanics that I intend to implement in the various MODifiable files, including EFS.INI, various DAT files, and many more.

Hyperion specializes in developing a very satisfying game playing experience that will require the player to manage their empire with much better skill than the standard game in order to be successful, including:

1. Formulaic unit design where every resource a unit uses improves a specific unit statistics and adds to a unit's cost, time to build, etc.
2. Firebird management is much more critical with players having to adjust the economy sliders to balance their budget at the start of the game.
3. Each unit is designed such that when acquired, it is useful and better than its predecessors making technology research crucial to a player's success in the game.
4. A vast tech tree with new and interesting tech development options to explore many different unit paths that will require many playthroughs to explore.

# Background
I created Hyperion for EFS back in the day during the late 1990's as I was inspired by the Nova MOD. I spent the next several years working on Hyperion with the last version, 1.4, released around the 2003 or so time frame and it was one of the most popular MODs at the time.

Realizing that I could never perfect the MOD with the deficiencies in the previous V1.4 EFS release, I acquired the game code from Andrew Greenberg and started working on fixing the game. Unfortunately, I did not have the requisite C++ programming experience / skill to fix many of the issues with the original code and so went through 3 different development periods between 2005 to 2008, 2015, and 2017, burning out each time due to my inability to fix the game code sufficiently to prevent random crashes while playing.

Nonetheless, all this development was saved in an Assembla repository where the changes that I made were put into "cold strorage" where they could still be accessed if needed.

In December 2021, I was once again contacted by Andrew to work on EFS V1.5. I decided to try once again, but this time we had an experienced C++ programmer on the team, Aleksandr Dorogov, and he was able to solve pretty much all the issues that I couldn't and I was allowed to focus on fixing / changing the issues that I could. I brought my changes out of cold storage that I worked on in the past (some of them were 15+ years old!) and one by one, started putting these changes into the eventual EFS V1.5. To this end, using Hyperion as my guide, the development team (which also includes Boris Okolodkov, who did a lot of the FLC art for Hyperion, Andrew, and Nikolai Skauge, who is a fellow MODder (he is currently developing Empyrean) and has been running the EFS Discord channel for many years keeping EFS's heartbeat going) was able to create EFS V1.5 that has many of the previous issues / restrictions either fixed or lifted.

With the release of EFS V1.5, I felt that my work on the game patch was still incomplete as I had issues with trying to implement Hyperion with V1.5 and there were still many, many loose ends. So we started working on EFS V1.51 immediately after the release of EFS V1.5. During the development period we added some amazing new teams members to help with the development of EFS V1.51: 1) Jonathan Campbell who has been instrumental in testing our proposed changes to a high level of quality and 2) Nicola Parolin who is the original developer of the Emperor Wars MOD and is equally adept and making changes to the game code. With these new team members, we were able to develop EFS V1.51 and release it at the end of February 2023.

I feel very confident that I was able to fix as many bugs and add as many features as my programming skill would allow. There's still significant work that we'd like to do to improve the game more, but for now we're taking a break from coding.

Now that we have released EFS V1.51, I can put my MODding hat back on and get into the art of MODding once again!

# Schedule

I released Hyperion V1.5 Lite late in 2022 and am now hard at work on the full version of Hyperion. It's taking quite a bit longer than I originally anticipated due to the fact that I'm redoing Hyperion from the ground up and exploring a rich technology tree (400+ techs) with a plethora of new units that will probably exceed 750. We'll see how it goes, but thanks for taking the time to read this and to understand how my passion in the game has been rekindled and it is my hope to provide you with a fun, challenging, and enjoyable EFS gaming experience.

Update 2023/04/09

Here is an update to how the current development of Hyperion is progressing:

1. Tech Tree Development:
   a. Medical & Biological Tree - 99% Complete of which 120 techs are included
   b. Physics & Energy Tree - 99% Complete of which 122 techs are included
   c. Psychosocial Engineering Tree - 95% Complete of which 54 techs are included
   d. Applied Technology Tree - 75% Complete of which which 115 techs are included
   e. That's a total of 411 techs so far and estimated 80% complete
2. Unit Development:
   a. 444 Unit Classes
   b. 657 Units with 95% of those designed
   c. Estimated 75% Complete

I am still researching game areas where I am expanding units to include a vast array of different technology avenues to explore and due to the breadth and depth of the technology tree and the vast number of units, it will take many playthroughs to explore the richness of the tech tree and experiment with different unit tech paths.

I'm trying to get a playable beta version out by the end of April, but we'll see how it goes as my time is very limited...
