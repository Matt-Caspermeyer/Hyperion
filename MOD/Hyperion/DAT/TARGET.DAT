{
// Changes V1.5
//
// Changed the weapon order as above
//
// Changes from V1.375 to V1.4
//
// Foot units are now vulnerable to Direct and Direct Space weaponry.
// Wheel, Tread, Naval, and Crawler units are now vulnerable to Close weaponry.
// The above changes are such that DAMAGE.DAT and Unit Agility will dictate
// whether a unit can be damaged rather than simply a weapon immunity.
// Because Starbases are so much more powerful now, the Space movement class
// is now vulnerable to Ranged Space weaponry.
// With the changes in UNIT.DAT, Naval units (Naval, Crawler, Water(Wheel)) are
// now vulnerable to Direct attacks again.
//
// Changes from V1.35 to V1.375beta
//
// Landers are now vulnerable to Ranged Space attacks again.
// Naval units without Indirect were vulnerable to Militia and other very
// weak units in the early game. I decided to remove Wheel and Crawler Direct
// combat vulnerability so that these units cannot be routed by Militia and
// other weak early units unless they have Indirect.
// Naval and Wheel units are now vulnerable to Direct Space and Close Space
// in case there are units that can be boarded aboard Space Carriers (which
// there aren't any right now, but it makes sense to make it this way) that
// have space weaponry.
//
// Changes from V1.2 to V1.35beta
//
// Naval units (Naval Transports and Submarines) were immune to Symbiots so
// I've changed it so that Naval is vulnerable to Indirect attack again.
// Space, like Landers, are invulnerable to Ranged Space weaponry
// Landers are now vulnerable to Direct and Close weapons. This means that Landers can attack other Landers
// in space with their Direct and Close weapons. Note that Direct weapons *only* work in space, Landers are
// hard-coded immune to Direct weapons on the ground.
// Due to any unit with space combat ability being able to launch from a Space Carrier (namely Crawlers)
// the ground units have been made vulnerable to various space weaponry (previously, Crawlers were
// invulnerable in space, as well as others).
// Space is now vulnerable to Ranged Space and Lander is now immune to Ranged Space.
// This is to account for the fact that all Landers are small vessels and hence too small for such weaponry.
// Naval are only vulnerable to Underwater and Psychic. This is for Non-PTS Submarines.
// Wheel and Crawlers are now susceptible to Ranged Space Attacks.
//
// Changes from V1.1 to V1.2
//
// Now that Non-PTS Naval units are Wheel Movement Type, they have the same immunities as Crawlers.
//
// Changes from V1.0 to V1.1
//
// Discovered that Landers are vulnerable to Indirect and Close while on the ground. However, if I
// make an entry of 1 in Indirect or Close, they will be vulnerable to Indirect and Close Combat in
// Space. If I have a 0 in Indirect or Close, they cannot be hit with Indirect and Close weapons in
// space. Lander units with Indirect and Close cannot hit other Lander units in space this way.
// Naval units cannot be hit with Ranged Space Weapons no matter what the entry.
