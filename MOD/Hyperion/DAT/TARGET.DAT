// Changes V1.52
//
// Crawler is now (Amphibious)Craft movement type
//
// Several weapons changes have been made due to new units and desired strategies / implications of these new units:
//
// 1. With the addition of Anti-Tank Obstacles (these were used during WW2), I've decided to make the Direct weapon
//    only damage Wheel, Tread, Naval, Hover, (Amphibious)Craft, and Lander move types. This means that Foot and
//    Mech units will not be harmed by these obstacles, while their use will be effective in repelling light and
//    medium tank or other types of light-armored units.
// 2. Close weapons now only target Foot and Mech units, meaning that units with only close weaponry cannot harm
//    Anti-Tank Obstacles (so these obstacles won't harm Foot and Mech units and units with only close can't harm
//    these obstacles, exactly how it played out in WW2) and other mechanized units.
// 3. Direct Space weapons can't attack Foot, Air, or Underwater units so that Gate units can use these weapons to
//    engage the other movement types if they are used during combat.
// 4. Close Space weapons can only attack Foot, Space, and Mech units.
// 5. Additionally, all ground weapons are considered not usuable in space combat and therefore cannot attack movement
//    types that cannot attack on the ground including Space and Jump units.
