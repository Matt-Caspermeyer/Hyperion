// Changes V1.5
//
// Resource cost has been updated for Hyperion Lite Units
//
// Changes from V1.35 to V1.4
//
// I had an error in the resource cost formula - it has been
// fixed and prices updated accordingly
// Prices have completely changed due to balancing planetary
// production and targeting a certain resource cost. These
// prices should be better for the beginning of the game
// for the low-tech resources and then as the game progresses
// the higher-tech resources are more expensive.
// Updated resource descriptions.
// All produced resources have been changed so that they scale
// better compared to other resources or more match the price
// based on usage and technology level.
//
// Changes from V1.3 to V1.35
//
// Slightly altered a few resource costs
// Fixed wording error in Electronics usage
//
// Changes from V1.2 to V1.3
//
// Changed the description to match how I used it in the game
//
// I thought the formulas I used in V1.2 were overly complex and so decided to greatly
// simplify the formulas and base a resources cost more on the price of its constituent
// resources and the technology needed to start producing that technology. I also thought
// that the gathered resource costs were too high, and so gestimated prices for the gathered
// resources that seemed to be more appropriate.
//
// Apply the following formulas when determining price:
//
// Gathered resource unit cost:
// Food = 1
// Energy = 5
// Metal = 2
// Trace = 10
// Exotica = 25
// Gems = 50
//
// Produced resource unit cost is determined by adding the total cost
// of all resources used to produce it divided by the number of that
// resource produced in the city plus the Research Point cost of the
// tech required to Build the city divided by the number of that resource
// produced in the city squared.
//
// Chemicals = (15*5 + 5*10) / 15 + 0 / 15^2 = 8
// Biochems = (25*5 + 5*25 + 10*8) / 25 + 250 / 25^2 = 14
// Electronics = (15*5 + 5*10) / 15 + 250 / 15^2 = 9
// Ceramsteel = (20*5 + 10*10 + 10*8) / 20 + 850 / 20^2 = 16
// Wetware = (60*5 + 15*14 +15*16) / 15 + 2500 / 15^2 = 56
// Monopols = (20*5 + 10*9) / 20 + 700 / 20^2 = 11
// Singularities = (25*5 + 10*11 + 15*50) / 1 + 1000 / 1^2 = 1990
//
// Changes from V1.0 to V1.2
//
// Changed the description to match how I used it in the game
//
// Apply the following formulas when determining price:
// If resource requires no technology to build it has a base of 100
// If the resource is used to create other resources then its cost
// is 100 for each resource it is used to create that does not require
// a tech and the research point cost for each tech it is used to create that
// requires a tech.
// If the resource requires a technology before it can be created or
// it is a produced resource, then its cost is the technology Research
// Point cost + the research cost of each resource it is used to create
// + the cost of all requisite resources + 500 base.
// All totals are then divided by the number of units it creates
// If the resource is harvested, then it is divided by its rareness factor
//
// Rareness Factors:
// Food = 100
// Energy = 150
// Metal = 50
// Trace = 25
// Exotica = 5
// Gems = 5
//
// Food - harvested, requires no technologies, and not required for any other resource: 100 / 100 = 1
// Energy - harvested, requires no technologies, and used to generate Chemicals, Electronics,
//          Biochems, Ceramsteel, Wetware, Monopoles, and Singularities; so its cost is:
//          [ 100 + 5700 + 100 ] / 150 = 39
// Metal - harvested, requires no technologies, and not required for any other resource = 100 / 50 = 2
// Trace - harvested, requires no technologies, and used to generate Chemicals, Electronics,
//         and Ceramsteel; so its cost is: [ 100 + 1100 + 100 ] / 25 = 52
// Exotica - harvested, requires no technologies, and used to generate
//           Biochems; so its cost is: [ 100 + 250 ] / 5 = 70
// Chemicals - produces 15, requires no technologies, used to generate
//             Biochems and Ceramsteel, and requires Energy and Trace;
//             so its cost is: [ 500 + 1100 + 100 + 39 + 48 ] / 15 = 119
// Biochems - produces 25, requires Pharmaceuticals (250), used to generate
//            Wetware, and requires Energy, Exotica, and Chemicals; so its cost is:
//            [ 500 + 2750 + 100 + 39 + 70 + 119 ] / 25 = 143
// Electronics - produces 15, requires Energy Physics (250), used to generate
//               Monopoles, and requires Energy and Trace; so its cost is:
//               [ 500 + 900 + 39 + 48 ] / 15 = 99
// Ceramsteel - produces 20, requires Ceramsteel (850), used to generate
//              Wetware, and requires Energy, Chemicals, and Trace; so its cost is:
//              [ 500 + 3350 + 100 + 39 + 119 + 48 ] / 20 = 208
// Wetware - produces 15, requires Wetware (2500), used to generate nothing
//           and requires Energy, Ceramsteel, and Biochems; so its cost is:
//           [ 500 + 3600 + 39 + 208 + 143 ] / 15 = 299
// Monopols - produces 20, requires Monopols (650), used to generate
//            singularities, and requires Energy and Electronics; so its cost is:
//            [ 500 + 1800 + 39 + 99 ] / 20 = 122
// Gems - harvested, requires no technologies, and used to generate singularities; so its cost is:
//        [ 100 + 900 ] / 5 = 200
// Singularities - produces 1, requires Cyclotron (900), not used to generate
//                 anything, and requires Energy, Gems, and Monopols; so its cost is:
//                 [ 500 + 1550 + 39 + 200 + 122] / 1 = 2411
