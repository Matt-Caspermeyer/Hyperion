}
// Notes:
//
// 1. YearPlayerCanAttackRuins - this parameter is used to prevent the AI (especially the Rebels from attacking ruins before a certain year).
//                               It should be noted that the Rebels don't actually attack ruins, but move through them, releasing the inhabitis
//                               which could cause issues if a doom stack is released to early in the game. It can also prevent other players
//                               (such as the Stigmata Garrison) from capturing ruins before it is assigned to a human player. After the designated
//                               year, the AI player will ignore these restrictions.
// 2. YearPlayerCanBuildNonB2Units - this parameter only affects the AI on B2. Normally, the AI only builds units that can attack on B2; however,
//                                   this restriction may be undersireable, especially if MODding the game. Setting this value to -1 will allow
//                                   the AI to build units in a city on B2 without considering whether the unit has the attack on B2 capability.
//                                   After the designated year, the player will be able to build any valid unit in B2 structure, regardless of
//                                   whether they have the attack on B2 ability or not.
// 3. YearPlayerCanUseB2Units - this parameter only affects the AI on B2. Normally, the AI is prevented from using any of its units on B2, which
//                              a MODder may wish to allow this behavior so that the AI player can leverage their units on B2. Note that this
//                              may leave the AI player more vulnerable to attack; therefore, a MODder should test this behavior with their
//                              MOD to ensure that the AI player does not leave Nobles open to easy assassinations. After the designated year,
//                              the AI player will be able to use their B2 units per the AI logic.
// 4. YearPlayerCanBuildOnB2 - this parameter affects both the human and AI player and allows that player to be able to build cities on B2. A
//                             MODder may decide that they want B2 players to build cities on that planet. After the designated year, the human
//                             or AI player will be able to build cities on B2.
//
// All AI players produce, build cities, and do research
// The League & Church now eat / consume food
// No players skip their turn
// Rebels are 100% productive
