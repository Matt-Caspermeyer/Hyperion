// Changes V1.5
//
// Changed the production output to suit Hyperion Lite
//
// Changes from V1.35 to V1.4
//
// All resource production has completely been redone to take into
// account a planet's ability to produce a certain level of output
// production capability based on gathered resources with Universal
// Wherehouse = OFF and to garner a certain price from the League
// Agoras. Removed is the excessive need for Energy, Chemicals have
// replaced Energy as the input resource for more advanced production
// structures. As such, the requirements for the more advanced resources
// have completely changed. This has also affected the resource prices
// making the low-tech resources cheaper while the higher-tech resources
// more expensive. This should balance resource production capability
// much better and also work better with the existing Hyperion galaxies.
//
// Changes from V1.2 to V1.35
//
// Chemicals now produce 25 units - this is to aid with the increase
// in Chemicals requirements for units.
// Electronics now produce 20 units.
// Chemicals and Electronics now consume 10 Trace.
// Cyclotrons now require 75 energy - I felt that Cyclotrons should
// require the most energy of any production facility.
//
// Changes from V1.0 to V1.2
//
// From the Upkeep / Turn formula:
// Ch = 2 (Requires En = 1, Trace (Tr) = 1)
// El = 2 (Requires En = 1, Tr = 1)
// Bi = 4 (Requires En = 1, Exotica (Ex) = 1, Ch = 2)
// Ce = 4 (Requires En = 1, Ch = 2, Tr = 1)
// We = 9 (Requires En = 1, Ce = 4, Bi = 4)
// Mo = 3 (Requires En = 1, El = 2)
// Si = 5 (Requires En = 1, Gems (Ge) = 1, Mo = 3)
//
// This means that the total number of resources needed
// to produce it are 10X its score for instance:
// Chemicals needs a total of 20 resources.
//
// The number of resources is limited by its maximum
// requirement number:
// For Chemicals, it requires 15 Energy, so it produces
// 15 Chemicals
// Exceptions to this are Wetware which is 1/4 or 15
// and Singularities which is 1/25 so 1
