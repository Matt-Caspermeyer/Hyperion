// Hyperion for EFS V1.52
//
// This has been a long time coming, but Hyperion has been reimagined for the latest version of EFS! The technology tree has been rebuilt, from the ground up, to include a vastly expanded array
// of technologies to choose from. The number of technologies (517) far exceed a normal game's worth of play with over 36,000 years of research that requires at least 360 Labs to store all the data.
// Players should find a significant amount of replay value with each new game of Hyperion!
//
// The like levels are now scaled by difficulty level (see EFS.INI: like_level_ ...) - the values change based on the difficulty level
// Note the Sect of the Patriarch's Heretical value in SECT.DAT subtracts a random value from the like so Patriarch's that have a higher Heretical
// Value are more intolerant of technology (and those with a value below 0 are more tolerant of technology).
//
// Like level values have been updated per their descriptions in the Manowitz Volumes and rescaled to a max of 20 (for average difficulty) to give greater resolution from most hated to best liked
//
// Like level: 0 used in game for when Patriarch accepts contract to proscribe and that is what will be done next turn
//             1 - ( like_level_proscribe-1 ), hate - automatically proscribed at the start of the game
//             like_level_proscribe - like_level_max, like - can be proscribed as the game progresses based on many factors decribed below
//
// When a new Patriarch is chosen:
//  1. The range of heretical values for all the Human Sects are assessed.
//  2. The techs are cycled through and a random value between the heretical ranges is generated:
//     a. If the random value is less than 0 (favorable to tech) then the tech likeLevel is increased by this modifier but no more than the like_level_max - 1
//  3. The last generatd random value is used:
//     a. If the random value is less than 0:
//         i. The like_level_proscribe is decreased by that value, but not more than the starting value at the beginning of the game
//        ii. like_level_decay is increased by that value, but not more than the starting value at the beginning of the game
//  4. like_level_years is reset
//
// When it comes to proscribing technology, here is how it works (refer to EFS.INI & SECT.DAT for actual parameter values):
//   1. Every year check if the tech like is > like_level_min & < like_level_max then:
//      a. There is a 1 in like_level_decay chance of the poosibility of
//      b. If like_level_decay_by_like = 0 in EFS.INI, then the like level is decremented by 1
//      c. If like_level_decay_by_like = 1 in EFS.INI, then another check is performed:
//         i. If Random Roll of like_level_max > like then tech drops 1 like point
//   2. If the ( tech like - the Patriarch's Heretical random modifier ) < like_level_proscribe then the tech is added to the pick list
//   3. The most hated techs in the pick list are used to randomly pick the most hated tech to proscribe for that turn
//      a. When the tech is proscribed, it is set to like_level_min - proscribe_reset_interval, meaning that it will not be able to be unproscribed until a like_level_years reset
//   4. If multi_tech_proscribe = 1 in EFS.INI there is a chance of proscribing more than 1 tech per year:
//      i. If a roll out of 100 is less than the number left in the pick list for that year after the first most hated tech is picked
//     ii. If multi_tech_proscribe = 0 in EFS.INI, then there is no chance to proscribe additional technologies
//   5. If no tech is found to proscribe this year, then like_level_years keeps track of how long it has been since a tech has been proscribed
//   6. If no tech has been found for like_level_years, then:
//      a. if ( like_level_proscribe < (like_level_max / 2 + 1) ) then like_level_proscribe is bumped up 1
//      b. else if ( like_level_decay > 2 ) then like_level_decay is bumped down by 1
//   Notes: From this it can be seen that like levels between min and max gradually float down over decades / centuries of playing and that the proscribe level can float up if many years
//          pass without finding a technology to proscribe, lastly, if the proscribed level is max, then the decay rate increases causing like values to fall more rapidly, giving the algorithm
//          a great deal of flexibilty in finding techs to proscribe throughout the course of a game
//
// When it comes to unproscribing technology:
//   1. If a technology has not been proscribed during that year, the possibility arises for a tech to be unproscribed.
//   2. The tech tree is cycles, if the technology is proscribed:
//      a. If the ( likeLevel - the Patriarch's Heretical random modifier ) > like_level_proscribe then the tech is added to the list of possible techs to unproscribe
//      b. Else If (Random value between 0 and likeLevel) > (the Patriarch's Heretical random modifier + a Random value between 0 and the like_level_proscribe) then the likeLevel is the tech is incremented by 1
//   3. If the unproscribe list has techs in it, unproscribe the tech with the highest like value, or if multiple techs have the same highest like value, choose one of those to unproscribe
//   4. When unproscribing a tech, its like value is set to like_level_max + unproscribe_reset_interval so that it will not be unproscribed until a like_level_years reset
//
// If a tech has not been selected to either proscribe / unproscribe:
//   1. like_level_years is decremented by 1
//   2. If like_level_years has fallen to 0:
//      a. Reset like_level_years
//      b. If like_level_proscribe < ( like_level_max / 2 + 1 ) like_level_proscribe is increased by 1
//      c. Else If like_level_decay > 2, then decrement it by 1
//      d. Cycle through the techs:
//          i. If likeLevel < like_level_min, increment likeLevel by 1
//         ii. Else If likeLevel > like_level_max, decrement likeLevel by 1
//             1. If likeLevel == like_level_max, reset likeLevel to like_level_proscribe + a Random number between 1 and like_level_proscribe
//
// For Diplomacy:
//   1. Requesting to Proscribe a Tech:
//      a. The tech's like value is computed (value must be 1 or higher): likeLevel + liveLevel / like_level_proscribe - the Patriarch's Heretical modifier
//      b. Compute the cost required to proscribe the tech: (Like Value)^2 * ( a Random value between proscribe_diplo_min and max ) * ( 150 - Church's Like of Player ) / 100 * diffScalar / 100
//      c. If the technology was just unproscribed, add ( a random value between force_proscribe_diplo_min and max ) * diffScalar / 100
//   2. Requesting to UnProscribe a Tech:
//      a. The tech's like value is computed (value must be 1 or higher): like_level_proscribe + like_level_proscribe / the tech's likeLevel (clipped at no lower than 1) + the Patriarch's Heretical random modifier
//      b. Compute the cost required to proscribe the tech: (Like Value)^2 * ( a Random value between unproscribe_diplo_min and max ) * ( 150 - Church's Like of Player ) / 100 * diffScalar / 100
//      c. If the technology was just unproscribed, add ( a random value between force_unproscribe_diplo_min and max ) * diffScalar / 100
//   3. If the player offers sufficient Firebirds then it is possible to (Un)Proscribe the Tech
//
//
// Vol and Ch are the volume and chapter where you can find more info in
// the Brother Manowitz files.
//
// Extra is added info about the technology.  This text is added onto a generated list of which technologies are allowed if you have this one.
//
// Owner means only that owner can research that tech - see UNIT.DAT for valid owner values

// Changes V1.52:
//
// The Main Technology groupings are organized as follows:
//
//   1. Medical & Biological (120 Technologies)
//   2. Physics & Energy (134 Technologies)
//   3. Psychosocial Engineering (75 Technologies)
//   4. Applied Technology (241 Technologies)
//
// There are significantly more techs in each grouping and a significant amount of research has gone into creating the tech trees based on mankind's current level of
// technology, past technological endeavors, and potential future technologies as well as a merging with the Fading Suns technology trees and weaving a cohesive tech
// tree for the game.
//
// The tech trees start mankind back at the World War I era of technology as they re-emerge from another Dark Age of their brutal and storied history.
//
// A lot of time was spent researching the units and technology of this period and it is my hope that players will get a better feel for this history of our world as
// they play a new Hyperion game. Tech then progresses through the interwar period between WW1 and WW2, through WW2, and beyond until modern times. It then weaves
// the Fading Suns lore into a possible future where the forefront of our current technology is progressed beyond modern times and well into the Fading Suns' future.
