// Technology Table
//
// The like levels are now scaled by difficulty level (see EFS.INI: like_level_ ...) - the values change based on the difficulty level
// Note the Sect of the Patriarch's Heretical value in SECT.DAT subtracts a random value from the like so Patriarch's that have a higher Heretical
// Value are more intolerant of technology (and those with a value below 0 are more tolerant of technology).
//
// Like level values have been updated per their descriptions in the Manowitz Volumes and rescaled to a max of 20 (for average difficulty) to give greater resolution from most hated to best liked
//
// Like level: 0 used in game for when Patriarch accepts contract to proscribe and that is what will be done next turn
//             1 - ( like_level_proscribe-1 ), hate - automatically proscribed at the start of the game
//             like_level_proscribe - like_level_max, like - can be proscribed as the game progresses based on many factors decribed below
//
// When it comes to proscribing technology, here is how it works (refer to EFS.INI & SECT.DAT for actual parameter values):
//   1. Every year check if the tech like is > like_level_min & < like_level_max then:
//      a. There is a 1 in like_level_decay chance of the poosibility of
//      b. If like_level_decay_by_like = 0 in EFS.INI, then the like level is decremented by 1
//      c. If like_level_decay_by_like = 1 in EFS.INI, then another check is performed:
//         i. If Random Roll of like_level_max > like then tech drops 1 like point
//   2. If the ( tech like - the Patriarch's Heretical random modifier ) < like_level_proscribe then the tech is added to the pick list
//   3. The most hated techs in the pick list are used to randomly pick the most hated tech to proscribe for that turn
//   4. If multi_tech_proscribe = 1 in EFS.INI there is a chance of proscribing more than 1 tech per year:
//      i. If a roll out of 100 is less than the number left in the pick list for that year after the first most hated tech is picked
//     ii. If multi_tech_proscribe = 0 in EFS.INI, then there is no chance to proscribe additional technologies
//   5. If no tech is found to proscribe this year, then like_level_years keeps track of how long it has been since a tech has been proscribed
//   6. If no tech has been found for like_level_years, then:
//      a. if ( like_level_proscribe < (like_level_max / 2 + 1) ) then like_level_proscribe is bumped up 1
//      b. else if ( like_level_decay > 2 ) then like_level_decay is bumped down by 1
//   Notes: From this it can be seen that like levels between min and max gradually float down over decades / centuries of playing and that the proscribe level can float up if many years
//          pass without finding a technology to proscribe, lastly, if the proscribed level is max, then the decay rate increases causing like values to fall more rapidly, giving the algorithm
//          a great deal of flexibilty in finding techs to proscribe throughout the course of a game
//
// Vol and Ch are the volume and chapter where you can find more info in
// the Brother Manowitz files.
//
// Extra is added info about the technology.  This text is added onto a generated list of which technologies are allowed if you have this one.
//
// Owner means only that owner can research that tech - see UNIT.DAT for valid owner values

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Changes V1.5
//
// Updated for EFS V1.5 & Hyperion Lite V1.5
//
// Changes from V1.375 to V1.4
//
// Assault Legions now require Cyber Robotics.
// Lots of technology requirement tweaks.
// Major errata update - now that the tech prerequisites, research costs, and
// church like factors are auto generated, all errors have been eliminated.
// Updated "extra" for most techs to be more descriptive or at least prompt the
// user to click on "Archive" for more information.
// Moved description for when Churches can be built from Meditation to Theurgy.
// Changed description of Wireblades to mention that Palaces can be built.
//
// Changes from V1.35b to V1.375b
//
// Armored Freighter is now called Armored Space Freighter.
// Swapped the positions of Composite Armor and Megachassis techs. Now, when
// the Physics Advanced Documentarium is selected, you will get Composite
// Armor instead of Megachassis.
//
// Changes from V1.2 to V1.35b (Subtract 15 from the line number to find the tech number)
//
// Swapped the positions of Megachassis and Composite Armor so that you get
// Composite Armor instead of Megachassis for the Physics Advanced Documentarium.
// Cloaking Shields now requires Raider Stealtship
// Assassins did not have Tracker Legion as a prerequisite - this error has been fixed
// Grim Reaper Field Tank now requires Assault Legion instead of Powered Ceramsteel Armor
// Changed Manowitz Applied Technology Volume/Chapter Pointers
// Updated Technology Research Point Cost Values
// Changed the name of Cure for Necrosis to Resistance to Necrosis
// Adjusted the Applied Tech Research Algorithm slightly
// Plague Bomb now requires Hovertech
// Armored Freighter now has a Church Dislike Negative of 2
// Powered Bulk Hauler now has a Church Dislike Negative of 3
// Raider Stealthship now has a Church Dislike Negative of 4
// Advanced Hovertech now has a Church Dislike Negative of 7
// Disconinuity Field Generator now has a Church Dislike Negative of 5
// Fractal Metaphysics now has a Church Dislike Negative of 4
// Necrosis now has a Church Dislike Negative of 9
// Assassin now requires Psychopharmacology
// Added Hostile Environment Mastery
// Xyll Warbeast requires Hostile Environment Mastery instead of Xenobiology
// Hostile Environment Mastery is now a requirement for Wetware
// Vau Psychology now requires Psychosonic Manipulation
// Alien Psychology now requires Xenobiology as a prerequisite
// Updated the technology information
// Changed Advanced Naval Carrier to PTS Meson Watercraft
// Changed Advanced Naval Destroyer to Advanced Minor Watercraft
// Changed Advanced Naval Battleship to Guided Missile Watercraft
//
// Fixed - A few technologies had errors in their technology requirement(s) that didn't match the Manowitz section.
// A lot of the Applied Techs have been slid from the first unit in a class to the second unit,
// for instance, Naval Destroyers are now Advanced Minor Watercraft. This is to help speed up
// the early game - Thanks to Kent Matthew Peterson for his suggestions on this.
// Chem Shock Legions is no longer a tech, instead Genetic Warrior Legion is a tech.
// Added the Ranger Legion Tech.
// Removed the Pitbull Battle Tank tech and replaced it with Killer Gunships tech.
// Rocket Legions now require Cyberpilot
// Dervishes now only require Psychosonic Manipulation and Theurgy
//
// Changes from V1.1 to V1.2
//
// The formulas for Tech Research Point cost have been modified so that techs now
// require much more Research Points to get. This puts more emphasis on the protection
// of Labs in multi-player games, because the upkeep cost for each tech is 1/100 of its
// Research Point Cost and so you will have to find better ways of keeping your labs safe
// from your enemies.
// 
// Changes from V1.0 V1.1
//
// Added Mechanized Warrior to the Applied Technology section
