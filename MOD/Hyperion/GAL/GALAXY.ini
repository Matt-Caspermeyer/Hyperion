; This file is autogenerated when a galaxy file is saved for the first time if no INI file already
; exists. If you wish for the file to be overwritten for every GAL file save, then set the value
; of "overwrite_gal_ini_file" in EFS.INI to 1; otherwise, set it to 0 and it is only created once.
;
; Note that the file naming format is GalName.GAL and then a GalName.INI file is created. If you
; see that there is already an INI file for said galaxy then the INI file already exists. It will
; not be overwritten unless overwrite_gal_ini_file=1 in EFS.INI is set.
;
; The purpose of this file is to provide a method to override the data saved in the galaxy file
; so that when loading the galaxy, changes can be made to the structure and unit data in program
; memory. The Map Designer needs to edit this file (following the instructions below) to enable
; structure and unit data overrides.
;
; When this file is first created, all overrides are disabled and this file has no effect on the
; Galaxy File's structure or unit data.
;
; If you are playing a game, this data will only be for the current instance of gameplay. If you
; are loading the galaxy in the Map Editor, these changes will become permanent if the Galaxy is
; saved so be careful if that is not your intent.
;
; The Map Designer is advised to make backups of their galaxy file to preserve data or use the
; Save As option to create a new galaxy.
;
; Note that when loading a Galaxy File in the Map Editor, a summary of all the data changed is
; presented to the Map Designer so that they know what data has been updated and they can decide
; what to do with the changed galaxy data.
;
; Instructions to Enable Overrides:
;
; Use the Keys under Home Worlds to set each player's Home World to a specific planet number.
; This can be used to set Home Worlds to planets other than Kish, Aragon, etc. for that player.
; Use the Keys under Global Settings to set Galaxy-wide parameters for each player
; Use the Keys under Galaxy Overrides to override a specific value when loading the GAL file
; Use the Keys under the Planet Names to override a specific value for that planet
;
; For the Global Settings, these are the galaxy-wide values for Sect, Loyalty, & Unit Experience
; and are used to override the in-code settings for glDefault-Sects, -Loyalty, & -Experience
;
; This file may also be used to programmatically add structures and units for a specific owner
; to the entire galaxy being edited as well as remove certain units and structures.
;
; For the overrides (Galaxy Overrides section):
;   Owner: the owner(s) to which the settings apply to (see UNIT.DAT for the owner values)
;   All others: a setting of 0 means to leave the value alone, and a value of 1 means that the
;               value is open to change
;
; For the Planet Keys, the following values are possible and used to change the GAL file settings
; upon load:
;   -100: leave that value alone
;
;   For Sects:
;   0: set the Sect of the City or Unit to the Sect of the Planet's Cathedral
;   5 - 13: set the Sect of the City or Unit to this Sect
;   -1, 22, 33, 44, 55, 77, 88, 99 - see UNIT.DAT for the applicable players that are used to
;   randomize the sect from the player's values in the Global Sect Settings
;   -666: set the Sect of the City or Unit to the Sect in the Global Sect Settings via owner
;
;   For Loyalty:
;   0 - 100: set the Loyalty of the City or Unit to that value
;   -1, -22, -33, -44, -55, -77, -88, -99 - see UNIT.DAT for the applicable players that are used
;   to randomize the sect from the player's values in the Global Sect Settings
;   XXYY: a random loyalty between XX to YY
;   XX100: a random loyalty between XX to 100
;   XYY: a random loyalty between X to YY
;   -666: set the Loyalty of the City or Unit to the Loyalty in the Global Loyalty Settings via
;   owner
;
;   Notes:
;       1. For X / YY and XX / YY combinations, it's preferable to specify X lower than YY and XX
;          lower than YY; however, it will sort the values so that the lower of the two is the lower
;          bound and the higher is the upper bound.
;   Examples:
;          120 -> 1 to 20
;          2575 -> 25 to 75
;          901 -> 9 to 1 resort to 1 to 9 or use 109 -> 1 to 9
;          7525 -> 75 to 25 resort to 25 to 75 or use 2575 as above
;       2. If X / YY or XX / YY are specified so that X = YY or XX == YY then it sets that loyalty.
;   Examples:
;          101 -> 1 to 1 set to 1 loyalty; however, prefer 1
;          303 -> 3 to 3 set to 3 loyalty; however, prefer 3
;          2525 -> 25 to 25 set to 25 loyalty; however, prefer 25
;       3. For XX, note that leading 0's are lost
;   Examples:
;          0001 -> is 1 so set to 1 loyalty
;          0010 -> is 10 so set to 10 loyalty
;          0175 -> 175 so set from 1 to 75 loyalty
;          01100 -> 1100 so set from 0 to 11 loyalty
;
;   For Experience:
;   0: Green
;   1: Expert
;   2: Elite
;   -1, 22, 33, 44, 55, 77, 88, 99 - see UNIT.DAT for the applicable players that are used to
;   randomize the experience from the player's values in the Global Sect Settings
;   100: Green or Expert
;   120: Expert or Elite
;   210: a random experience setting
;   -666: set the Experience of the Unit to the Experience in the Global Experience Settings via
;   owner
;
; If you no longer wish to have the INI override the Galaxy's Data, you have 3 choices:
;   1. Edit this file to disable the overrides you no longer wish to use
;   2. Rename this file so that the Galaxy no longer has an INI file
;   3. Delete this file so that the Galaxy no longer has an INI file
;
; Note that for both option 2 and 3 above, that a new INI file will be created when saving the Galaxy
; File if none exists already.
