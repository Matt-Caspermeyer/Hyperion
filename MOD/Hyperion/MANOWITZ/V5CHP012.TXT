Biochem-Enhanced Soldiers are specialized units designated with a (BE) after the unit's name. These types of units are an upgrade to their base unit and often offer a more substantial increase in most unit statistics compared to their base unit.

Note that although the substances used are not as crude as those for Performance-Enhanced Soldiers, that these units may still suffer the side effects of the drugs after combat.

All unit upgrades are performed at a Bioplant to ensure that the procedure is successful.
