The Wheel movement type typically has the fastest movement rate along roads.

It is comprised mainly of mechanical units that use wheels for their locomotion.

They are capable of moving on any land terrain hex but typically suffer the highest penalties for moving through rough terrain.


The following lists the movement class terrain agility bonus or penalty additive values (all others have no effect):

Desert		-1
Ice		-2
Tundra		-1
Mountain	-5
Hill		-2
Tree		-4
River		-6
Delta		-3
