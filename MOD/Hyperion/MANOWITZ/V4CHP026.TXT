Clever illusions and demon-spawned lies
(By such as these is the warlock concealed)

To snuff all the stars from the dolorous skies
(Only with this is the warlock content)

Vigilant heed to the Innermost Light
(By such as this is the warlock revealed)

The pyre, the flamegun, the unerring smite
(THUS is the warlock to damnation sent!)

  chant and choral response, spoken by an Avestite prelate to her pupils

(Such zealotry on the part of the Avestites has scourged many a fiendish warlock and unleashed brutal pogroms on no few innocent worlds, but la, who is a lowly Orthodox bishop to question the Avestites' most righteous methods?)
