And look ye to the barbarian worlds beyond our frontiers, for, despite their savagery, the purveyors of forbidden technology would move among them and forge the hordes into a vast and implacable Dark Empire. 

The Vuldrok, I am told, speak of certain cunning and warlike barbarians dwelling beyond even their own tribe's far frontier. These heathens are said to travel in enormous craft that bear the stamp of both vessel and golem. For the barbarians have mastered a wondrous metal which has been imbued with an unnatural life, enabling a vessel forged from it to transform its carapace into a multiplicity of shapes. And thus can the same craft perform a variety of military functions, merely by invoking its transmogrifying power.
