And despite their vaunted powers, most warlocks are afraid to test their mettle on the battlefield; thus they cloak themselves with all manner of trickery and illusions. The most blatantly demonic of these I cite from an account by Brother Pallas, who describes one such warlock, Pazu'ul by name. This worthy, ignominiously defeated on the dueling grounds by the Li Halan champion Procrustes, spoke words of power and made signs to his demonic master, whereupon his mail shimmered like the fireflies of Severus' marshes, and the fiend vanished forthwith into the very firmament.
