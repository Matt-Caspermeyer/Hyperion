And now to the crux of my dialogues: Where, precisely, does one differentiate between humankind gainfully putting the Pancreator's works to good use as Holy Zebulon himself ordained, and warlocks perverting these selfsame components to all manner of fiendish ends?

When does the invisible hand that raises nourishing kwij-fungi from the Salathian fields, or carries the messenger-kites aloft through the heavens, become the monstrous talon that scatters demon-seeds of plague amid the groaning worlds, or dashes temples asunder with radioactive hellfire?
