I myself have seen the skeleton of one of the great automata preserved in the Great Cathedral at De Molay, intact save for the slag-marks inflicted by the Direwolf that laid it low.

What a fearful thrill, to see the great metal frame stretching up and up, nigh unto the dome of the nave; to touch, fearfully, the great block of the motor, formerly a cauldron of animating hell-flame; to hear, faintly, the creak of the cables and ceramsteel cylinders, as if the spectre of the fallen beast yet moaned for life.
