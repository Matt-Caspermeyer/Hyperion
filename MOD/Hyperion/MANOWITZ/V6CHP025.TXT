A Farm is a harvesting city that collects Food and Exotica.

Without Food, an empire will rapidly fall into ruin and therefore an astute ruler will ensure that there are sufficient Farms to prevent the starvation of their cities and units.

Farms are crucial to the success of any empire, but note that they can only be built a certain distance from other harvesting cities.
