"When I send my Archangel into Immelmann rolls over the terrain of Byzantium Secundus when I press the copper stud into my skull when my sight is made transcendent by the visor on my VR helmet when I feel the throbbing pulses from my ship's brain ejaculate themselves into my skull, and I engage in intimate congress 10,000 meters above the curve of the world. Yea, I shall say it! I am communing with the Pancreator, and who are ye to gainsay it?"
