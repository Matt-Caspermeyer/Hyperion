" and let death be the reward also of those ghouls who, smugly citing Rebbun Zebbuk's famous Autoeminencine Canticle, disport amid alien necropoli, seeking thereby to glean the unholy sorcery of the Symbiots, the Ukar, even the Vau themselves! Suffer no such warlocks to come among ye, but raise your fists against them, and steel your ears from their blandishments and harlot's promises of power."

  from the sermon given by Archbishop Lycrecia to the people of Criticorum

(I can find little fault with the archbishop's sentiment, I might add.)
