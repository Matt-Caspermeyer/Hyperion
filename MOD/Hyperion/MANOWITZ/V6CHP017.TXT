An Alien Ruin is an ancient building built by some long-forgotten alien race that may contain a cadre of defenders that protect some unknown reward.

An astute ruler will respect the denizens of a Alien Ruin and use overwhelming force to ensure the inhabitants are defeated so that they may claim their reward.

Beware; hoever, because there may be technological marvels that far exceed the imagination of current experts that may be unleashed and cause planetary havoc.
