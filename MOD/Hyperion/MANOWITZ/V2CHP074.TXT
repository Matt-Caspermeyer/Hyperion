Some might name me uncharitable for decrying this admittedly wondrous technique, which my Eskatonic colleague Schwartzen avers outright is the kiss of the Pancreator made manifest for, he posits, is not this restoration of bodily workings a tangible manifestation of their spiritual counterparts reelevated to their perfect form in the Empyrean's grace? 

While I certainly respect the philosophies of the Eskatonics, I myself (a simple Orthodox devotee for whom the words of the Prophet must needs serve as transcendence enough) prove somewhat more skeptical. Certainly history and theologic discourse bear witness to innumerable incidents of demons assuming fair guises, even performing good works, to seduce the innocent into wickedness.
