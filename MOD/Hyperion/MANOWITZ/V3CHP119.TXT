Verily one might argue that a divine of sufficient learning can command the metal golems of the Lost Age, even as Suleiman the Ancient sported with demons and wrestled the afreet of the Zylok Wastes. Yet Suleiman thou art not: Mind ye that metal animated as flesh yet retains its nature unyielding and opaque, so that even the veriest Light merely reflects distorted images from its brazen hide. And by these signs may ye become aware of the golem's nature.
