Drug-Enhanced Soldiers are specialized units designated with a (DE) after the unit's name. These types of units are an upgrade to their base unit and often offer a much betteer increase in most unit statistics compared to their base unit and even that of a Biochem-Enhanced Soldier (BE).

Note that due to the refinement of the substances used there are no side effects from the drugs after combat.

All unit upgrades are performed at a Bioplant to ensure that the procedure is successful.
