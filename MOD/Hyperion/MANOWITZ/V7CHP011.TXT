The Mech movement type is able to transit between the ground and space.

It is comprised mainly of mechanical units that use more advanced engines to transit between land and space.

They are not able to use the jump gates, and move on the ground similar to Foot units with similar terrain penalties.

Note that they can land on the ground outside of cities without suffering any damage.
