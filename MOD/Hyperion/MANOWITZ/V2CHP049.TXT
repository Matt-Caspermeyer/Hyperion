On the subject of narcotic chemicals, I cannot help but pen my thoughts regarding the practice of certain legions of the Celestial Sun's own Brothers Battle. These worthies, before a battle with barbarians or Symbiots, often inflame their passion and heighten their quickness through the ingestion of a certain synthetic powder known in League parlance as klaj.

I applaud the valor of the Brothers, and certainly advocate the Pancreator's stalwarts utilizing whatever advantage they can attain against the forces of iniquity. But take care, O my Brothers, that in so doing thine own actions do not prove more deleterious than the snares of the enemy; for what is it to gain one's life if in so doing one sacrifices one's soul?
