"Look on this shell, ye unbelievers! Look on this war-mail of the tyrant Ashur-baal, whom ye dreaded more than the coming of the Musters. See the spiked helmet, wherefrom he would issue commands and order punishments, now rent tripartite; view, O newly liberated, the cuirass, which turned blade and beam alike, now collapsed as paper before the Pancreator's fury; look upon the gauntlets and greaves, with which he would smash the innocent and trample the defenseless, now slagged nigh to unrecognizability."

  (Revised) Omega Gospels, chapter 38, verse 6

(An invaluable lesson to those of overweening worldly conceit; one of my favorite parables, as well as one of the more practical.)
