The Shield is one of the most important cities on a planet and there can be only one of its kind on a planet.

The player that controls the Shield is able to protect cities within a 1-hex radius of the Shield from orbital bombardment.

Losing the planet's Shield city will no longer afford protection from orbital bombardment.

An astute ruler will keep their Shield cities heavily defended and prevent them from falling into enemy hands.
