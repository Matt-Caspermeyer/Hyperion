" these infernal shells consecrated to the red demons of war that haunt the seventy-second hell, and which rend metal, stone and flesh with little discrimination. From their fiery malediction nothing is safe, nothing is sacred: not the monastery at De Molay or the cathedral at Pentateuch."

  from the Daemonomica of Sutek
