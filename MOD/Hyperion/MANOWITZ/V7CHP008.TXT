The Jump movement type is able to transit between the ground and space and can also use the jump gates.

It is comprised mainly of mechanical units that use powerful rocket engines to transit between land and space.

They are able to use the jump gates, and move on the ground just like Air units, unencumbered by any terrestrial terrain.

Note that they can suffer damage when landing on the ground outside of cities.
