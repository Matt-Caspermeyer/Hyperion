" ... constructs whereby those versed in the proper protocols may call unto the jumpgates and, provided the plea is couched respectfully, be heard. Mayhap these devices serve as altars or menhir-stones of sorts; certes all who have approached the gates without bearing such a talisman have been rebuffed or worse."
