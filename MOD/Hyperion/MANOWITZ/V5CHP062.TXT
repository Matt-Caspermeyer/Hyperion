Neumonically-Enhanced Soldiers are specialized units designated with an (NE) after the unit's name. These types of units are the next upgrade to Antivirally-Enhanced (AVE) units that offer a substantial increase in camouflage due to the use of Neumonic Amor.

Note that they inherit all the previous abilities of their source unit.

All unit upgrades are performed at a Fusorium to ensure that the procedure is successful.
