"And, at the angel's bidding, I peered through the lenses salvaged from the lost city of the Second Republic. And a potent Sign revealed itself unto me. The Sign takes the form of a twin spiral, barred to form a shape not unlike a twisted ladder. Amid its lattices I saw those motes which differentiate Hawkwood from harlot, Decados from derelict, and understood by what a fragile thread did the nobles retain their lofty seats. And the angel spake unto me, saying,  This Sign is the puzzle the Pancreator has set for ye, by the deciphering of which ye may become as the Pancreator, and in truth be reabsorbed into the Empyrean, as is the Pancreator's will."
