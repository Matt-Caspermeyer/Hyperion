"And so it came to pass that the Most Holy Rebbun Zebbuk went into the dens of the salacious Guildmeister Sheddoom, seeking by example to bend even this miscreant to the Way. And such a sight was His Holiness impelled to endure: For amid sligskin divans and carven alcoves cavorted a Dionysian throng such as might have leapt from the pages of Thifune's Ebon Grimoire. Loathsome to his eyes was their aspect; but more loathsome still were the soporific substances that they inhaled and chewed and drank and sucked and inserted into unspeakable orifices. 

A multitude of madmen assailed the Holy One: Cowled figures of dubious shape howled as lysys-demons carried their minds to dark and unknown planets; naked lunatics ran hither and yon as the klaj they had imbibed spasmed its way through their bodies; Musters in the throes of jaij-sickness cried out to wicked and forbidden gods; and slaves silently wept as they chewed the stems of a strange alkaloid herb found growing only on the dark side of Algol V at eclipse."
