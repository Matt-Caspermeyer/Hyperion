"And from the pitchy shadows  twixt the stars let the Dark Crawler fall and stalk unseen among thee; and let none   not a man, not a woman, not a newborn babe escape the Crawler's wrath; and ye shall lament loudly unto the heavens, and falsely implore the Immanent even as thy praying fingers wither and drop about thy deliquescing ankles; but it shall avail thee not; for the hour is upon thee, and judgment is at hand."

  curse of Holhoon the Patriarch, delivered to the inhabitants of Jalehl, one week before that city's depopulation via Necrosis

(An odd aside. Is this "Necrosis" but another sobriquet for the Moax, or another breed of plague-demon altogether?)
