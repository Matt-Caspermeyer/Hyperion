I mistrust those academes who would study the carriers of the million Invisible Deaths. They would have us believe that the pestilences which bedevil Urthkind are not the work of demons, but are inflicted by a host of rapacious animalcules minuscule but otherwise normal components of a planetary ecosystem. 

By such works do the very demons of which I have spoken cast doubt upon sinners' souls, as a laborer shovels dirt onto an open flame, that it may ebb.
