And the Pancreator ignited a flame in the bellies of the Battle-Brothers, and surrounding bystanders averred that the company's very eyes blazed with celestial fire, so that they could see no falsehood, but only what the Pancreator inspired them to see. And so they went among the people of that Symbiot-plagued hovel, and, in order that the cancer be excised fully, cut down all among them infected with the demon-taint, yea, to the last babe.

(Yet another example of Avestite mercy but none can gainsay their thoroughness.)
