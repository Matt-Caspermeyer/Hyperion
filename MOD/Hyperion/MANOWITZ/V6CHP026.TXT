An Arborium is a harvesting city that collects Food and Exotica at levels that exceed that of a Farm.

Without Food, an empire will rapidly fall into ruin and therefore an astute ruler will ensure that there are sufficient Farms and Arboriums to prevent the starvation of their cities and units.

Arboriums are crucial to the success of any empire, but note that they can only be built a certain distance from other harvesting cities.

The following units are available for building at an Arborium city depending on the level of technological research:

1. (13) Fence (100)
2. (32) Wire Obstacle (100)
3. (38) Peasant (100)
4. (43) Engineer (99)
5. (55) Barbed Wire (99)
6. (84) Razor Wire (98)
7. (142) Anti-Tank Pyramid (97)
8. (208) Bunker (97)
9. (229) Concertina Wire (96)
10. (423) Fortification (93)
11. (585) PTS Fortification (88)
12. (1108) PTS Fortification II (86)
13. (1541) PTS Fortification III (82)
