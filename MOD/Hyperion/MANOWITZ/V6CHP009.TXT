Ceramsteel is used to create more heavily-armored units that are lighter and more agile than those made with Metal or Composite Armor and may be consumed to produce more advanced resources.

The following units are available for building at a Ceramsteel city depending on the level of technological research:

1. (13) Fence (100)
2. (32) Wire Obstacle (100)
3. (38) Peasant (100)
4. (43) Engineer (99)
5. (55) Barbed Wire (99)

7. (142) Anti-Tank Pyramid (97)
8. (208) Bunker (97)
9. (229) Concertina Wire (96)
10. (423) Fortification (93)
