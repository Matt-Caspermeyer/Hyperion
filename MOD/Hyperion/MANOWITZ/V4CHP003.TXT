From ancient times we of Urth have utilized a number of techniques for communing with the Empyrean through the purgation of the Self. From the holy man who wanders alone in the desert, to the abbess who silently prays beneath the cruciform circle, such psychic keys enable humans to cast off their worldly vestments and bask in the spiritual radiance of the Pancreator. Take care though, for meditation in all its forms is a doorway to the soul, and the improper practitioner may open himself to the Light or the Shadow.
