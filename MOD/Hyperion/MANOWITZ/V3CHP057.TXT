" and, laughing, the infidel Decados did taunt the most righteous Battle-Brother, and utter all manner of blasphemies, and in so doing called unto him to humble her through fire and sword. And raising her hand in a mocking salute, she lunged forward, weaving that selfsame hand widdershins and cruciform, as if mad. And woe! For in truth the Decados invoked magick most foul; a coven of invisible demons came at her summons, and the Battle-Brother fell at the heathen noble's feet, hewn sorcerously into gobbets."

  from the Narrative of the Gazim Protocols

(The book doubtless speaks of the wireblade weapons which the heedless nobles procure from the Guilds even now: wondrous but foul tools whereby an armored soldier can be invisibly hewn asunder.)
